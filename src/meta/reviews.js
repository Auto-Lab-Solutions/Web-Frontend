        review: "Today, we went to inspect a corolla 2015 . And he was really good at inspecting things. Like normally another person will inspect for 20-30mins. But he inspected the car for 1hr by looking all the interior parts like engine, belts, gasket, under the vehicle and everything that should be looked before buy a car. And at the end he gave us all the pros and cons by giving us the chance to decide. More likely he was friendly, not judging ( we can ask anything). That's the thing we need in a pre purchase inspection. And he gives a service that includes everything. !!!",

He was able to accommodate to meet at the seller's home which was a fair distance away, which I greatly appreciated. I'd highly recommend him for your pre purchase needs. Thanks.",

I got sent a full report about an hour later - but I got the thumbs up at the appointment so I could go ahead with the sale. Very impressed and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to buy a preowned car!",
